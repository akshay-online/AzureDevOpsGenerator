Workspace: # Running the ADOGenerator Project as a Console Application

To run the ADOGenerator project as a console application or executable, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version compatible with the project)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other preferred IDE

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open the Solution**
   Open the 

ADOGenerator.sln

 solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

3. **Set ADOGenerator as the Startup Project**
   In Visual Studio:
   - Right-click on the 

ADOGenerator

 project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select 

Set as Startup Project

.

4. **Build the Solution**
   Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are restored and the project compiles successfully:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the Project**
   To run the project as a console application:
   - In Visual Studio, press `F5` or click on the 

Start

 button.
   - Alternatively, you can run the project from the command line:
     ```sh
     dotnet run --project src/ADOGenerator/ADOGenerator.csproj
     ```

6. **Publish the Project**
   To create an executable, publish the project:
   ```sh
   dotnet publish src/ADOGenerator/ADOGenerator.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
   ```
   This command will generate an executable in the `bin/Release/net8.0/win-x64/publish` directory (adjust the framework and runtime identifier as needed).

7. **Run the Executable**
   Navigate to the publish directory and run the executable:
   ```sh
   cd src/ADOGenerator/bin/Release/net8.0/win-x64/publish
   ./ADOGenerator.exe
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that any required configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.json`) are present in the output directory.
- If you encounter any issues, check the console output for error messages and resolve any missing dependencies or configuration issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the ADOGenerator project as a console application or executable.
